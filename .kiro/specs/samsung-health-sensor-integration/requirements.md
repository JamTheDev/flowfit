# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document specifies the requirements for integrating Samsung Health Sensor API into the FlowFit Flutter application for Galaxy Watch 6 (Wear OS). The integration will enable the application to access real-time biometric data from the watch's sensors, including heart rate, accelerometer, and other health metrics. This integration requires proper Android configuration, runtime permissions, and a communication bridge between Flutter and native Android code.

## Glossary

- **Samsung Health Sensor API**: Samsung's proprietary API for accessing health sensor data on Galaxy Watch devices
- **FlowFit Application**: The Flutter-based health and fitness tracking application
- **Wear OS**: Google's operating system for smartwatches
- **AAR File**: Android Archive file containing compiled Android library code
- **Method Channel**: Flutter's mechanism for communication between Dart and native platform code
- **Runtime Permission**: Android permission that must be explicitly requested from the user at runtime
- **Gradle**: Android's build system and dependency management tool
- **AndroidManifest**: XML file declaring app permissions and components

## Requirements

5. WHEN the application checks permission status, THE FlowFit Application SHALL return the current permission state without requesting again

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to establish a communication bridge between Flutter and native Android code, so that Dart code can invoke Samsung Health Sensor API methods.

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to initialize the Samsung Health Sensor API connection, so that the application can start receiving sensor data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts, THE FlowFit Application SHALL check if Samsung Health services are available on the device
2. WHEN Samsung Health services are available, THE FlowFit Application SHALL establish a connection to the health tracking service
3. WHEN the connection is established, THE FlowFit Application SHALL verify that required sensors are supported
4. WHEN the connection fails, THE FlowFit Application SHALL provide error information and retry logic
5. WHEN the application is closed, THE FlowFit Application SHALL properly disconnect from Samsung Health services

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to access real-time heart rate data from my Galaxy Watch, so that I can monitor my heart rate during activities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN heart rate tracking is started, THE FlowFit Application SHALL begin receiving heart rate measurements from the watch sensor
2. WHEN a new heart rate measurement is available, THE FlowFit Application SHALL deliver the data to the Flutter layer within 2 seconds
3. WHEN heart rate tracking is stopped, THE FlowFit Application SHALL cease sensor data collection and release resources
4. WHEN the sensor is unavailable, THE FlowFit Application SHALL notify the user and handle the error gracefully

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to handle sensor lifecycle events properly, so that the application efficiently manages resources and battery life.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application moves to the background, THE FlowFit Application SHALL pause non-critical sensor tracking
2. WHEN the application returns to the foreground, THE FlowFit Application SHALL resume sensor tracking if it was previously active
3. WHEN sensor tracking is active, THE FlowFit Application SHALL run as a foreground service with a notification
4. WHEN all tracking is stopped, THE FlowFit Application SHALL stop the foreground service and remove the notification

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user with both a Galaxy Watch and Android phone, I want heart rate data collected on my watch to automatically sync to my phone app, so that I can view and analyze my biometric data on a larger screen.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the watch collects heart rate data, THE FlowFit Application SHALL send the data to the paired phone via Wearable Data Layer API
2. WHEN the phone receives heart rate data from the watch, THE FlowFit Application SHALL deliver the data to the Flutter layer within 2 seconds
3. WHEN the watch attempts to send data, THE FlowFit Application SHALL discover connected phone nodes using CapabilityClient
4. WHEN no phone nodes are available, THE FlowFit Application SHALL handle the error gracefully and queue data for later transmission
5. WHEN the phone app is not running, THE FlowFit Application SHALL launch the phone app upon receiving watch data

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use consistent message paths and data formats for watch-to-phone communication, so that data transfer is reliable and maintainable.
