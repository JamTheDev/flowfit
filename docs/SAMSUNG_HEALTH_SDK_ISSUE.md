# Samsung Health SDK Connection Issue - Diagnosis

## Problem Summary

The Samsung Health Tracking Service connection **never completes**. The `ConnectionListener` callbacks (`onConnectionSuccess`, `onConnectionFailed`, `onConnectionEnded`) are never invoked.

```
I/HealthTrackingManager: 🔄 Attempting to connect to Health Tracking Service
I/HealthTrackingManager: ⏳ Waiting for connection callback...
[10 seconds pass - NOTHING HAPPENS]
TimeoutException: Future not completed
```

## Root Cause

The Samsung Health Tracking Service is either:
1. **Not installed** on the Galaxy Watch 6
2. **Not running** or disabled
3. **Wrong SDK version** - AAR library mismatch with watch OS

## Samsung Health Tracking Service Requirements

### What is it?
The Samsung Health Tracking Service is a **system service** that must be installed on the watch to access health sensors via the SDK.

### Where to get it?
- **Pre-installed** on most Samsung Galaxy Watches
- **Galaxy Store**: Search for "Samsung Health Tracking Service"
- **Package name**: `com.samsung.android.service.health.tracking`

## Diagnostic Steps

### Step 1: Check if Service is Installed

Run this command to check if the service package exists:

```bash
adb -s <watch_device_id> shell pm list packages | grep health
```

**Expected output** (if installed):
```
package:com.samsung.android.service.health.tracking
package:com.samsung.health
```

**If missing**: The service is not installed.

### Step 2: Check Service Version

```bash
adb -s <watch_device_id> shell dumpsys package com.samsung.android.service.health.tracking | grep versionName
```

**Expected**: Version should be compatible with SDK 1.4.1

### Step 3: Check if Service is Running

```bash
adb -s <watch_device_id> shell dumpsys activity services | grep health.tracking
```

### Step 4: Try to Start Service Manually

```bash
adb -s <watch_device_id> shell am startservice com.samsung.android.service.health.tracking/.HealthTrackingService
```

## Possible Solutions

### Solution 1: Install Samsung Health Tracking Service

1. Open **Galaxy Store** on the watch
2. Search for "Samsung Health Tracking Service"
3. Install/Update the service
4. Restart the watch
5. Try the app again

### Solution 2: Update Watch OS

The service might be missing due to outdated OS:

1. Open **Settings** on watch
2. Go to **About watch** → **Software update**
3. Update to latest Wear OS version
4. Restart watch

### Solution 3: Use Alternative SDK Version

The AAR library version might be incompatible. Try different versions:

**Current**: `samsung-health-sensor-api-1.4.1.aar`

**Alternatives to try**:
- Version 1.4.0
- Version 1.3.0
- Latest from Samsung Developer site

### Solution 4: Factory Reset Watch (Last Resort)

If service is corrupted:
1. Backup watch data
2. Factory reset watch
3. Re-pair with phone
4. Service should be reinstalled

## Alternative Approach: Use Android Sensor API Directly

If Samsung Health SDK continues to fail, you can use the standard Android Sensor API instead:

```kotlin
val sensorManager = getSystemService(Context.SENSOR_SERVICE) as SensorManager
val heartRateSensor = sensorManager.getDefaultSensor(Sensor.TYPE_HEART_RATE)

if (heartRateSensor != null) {
    sensorManager.registerListener(
        heartRateListener,
        heartRateSensor,
        SensorManager.SENSOR_DELAY_NORMAL
    )
}
```

**Pros**:
- Works on all Android Wear devices
- No special service required
- Simpler implementation

**Cons**:
- No IBI (Inter-Beat Interval) data
- Less accurate than Samsung SDK
- No advanced health metrics

## Testing the Fix

After installing/fixing the service:

1. **Uninstall app**:
   ```bash
   adb uninstall com.example.flowfit
   ```

2. **Rebuild and install**:
   ```bash
   flutter run -d <watch_device_id> -t lib/main_wear.dart
   ```

3. **Watch for connection success**:
   ```
   I/HealthTrackingManager: ✅ Health Tracking Service connected successfully
   I/HealthTrackingManager: ✅ Heart rate tracking is supported
   ```

## Expected Working Flow

When the service is properly installed and working:

```
I/HealthTrackingManager: 🔄 Attempting to connect to Health Tracking Service
I/HealthTrackingManager: ⏳ Waiting for connection callback...
I/HealthTrackingManager: ✅ Health Tracking Service connected successfully  <-- THIS SHOULD APPEAR
I/HealthTrackingManager: ✅ Heart rate tracking is supported
I/flutter: 🐛 Native permission status: granted
I/flutter: 💡 Watch connected successfully
```

## Next Steps

1. **Check if service is installed** (Step 1 above)
2. **If not installed**: Install from Galaxy Store
3. **If installed but not working**: Try updating watch OS
4. **If still failing**: Consider using Android Sensor API fallback
